Annotation tool
---------------

Anything that we would like to write about the annotation tool:
* We could start by a description of how the tool works / looks like 
  from the perspective of the annotator.  We could also give 
  a screenshot at this point.  It should be emphasized that the tool
  allows syntactic annotation and temporal annotation in parallel.
* Description of the architecture could follow here: client/server architecture
  (+ a database), the technology used (Elm, haskell).
* The fact that it's online should eventually allow a more collaborative
  annotation style; besides, (which is less important, I suppose,)
  this facilitates the installation process (the tool can be used on
  any machine supplied with a standard internet browser)
* It would be nice to mention this: we would like to make the "collaboration"
  between the annotator and the syntactic parser more interactive.
  The idea is that, e.g., the annotator be able to select parts of the
  syntactic structure as correct and ask the parser to provide the most plausible
  syntactic structure which satisfies the user-specified constraints.
