JY is involved in three projects. Apart from that, you can always co-operate with him on:
* dyslexiy (related to predict4all below, if I remember correctly)
* coreference

# ODIL

You know what it is about.

# Predict4All

Starts in November 2017, there is already somebody for this position (of course
you can cooperate).

The project is about using "latent semantic analysis" for predicting words
(predicting the next words on the basis of the previous ones).

# TALAD

The response for this project will arive soon.

The project is about "discourse analysis" -- how the new words arise in
political discourse? Something like that :-).

The techniques they want to use:
* Named entity recognition
* Coreference resolution
