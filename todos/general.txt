TODO:
* Consider the quesion of "speech turns" -- should they be represented as separate trees?
  I suppose so (issue raised during the TLN meeting, Mai 18, Blois)
  -> JY, AL: it should be visible (colors, labels) who is speaking at a given moment.
     If there are many speakers for a given speech turn, they should be parsed separately,
     and visible as a part of the same speech turn, like this:

    <Turn 1>, <spk1>: ble ble ble
    <Turn 2>, <spk1>: ble ble ble ble
            , <spk2>: bla bla
            , <spk1>: blu blu bly
    <Turn 3>, <spk2>: ble ble ble

* Compute the number of words in the files pre-selected by JY, too see what portion
  of 20000 words does it make.


DONE:
* Keep the original sentences and show them on the right in the annotation tool
