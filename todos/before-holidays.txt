This file summarizes the most important tasks that should be carried out and
changes that should be incorporated before the summer holidays.



# Marking links with different attribute values

It's quite a high priority.



# Pre-processing

Removing the "strings" that are of no interest to us.

PROBLEM: we also consider manual removal. The issue with this is that we cannot
easily replicate this behavior when parsing the 100,000-words part of the
corpus.



# Rule-based engine

For the moment, to automatically deepen the trees. The changes should be visible
and each one of them should be manually validated by the annotator.



# Other parsing engines

It would be nice to support some other parsing tools, e.g.:
* DiscoDOP
* ...

Ideally, it would be nice to have the following:
* constraint-based parsing, or
* k-best parsing

The latter would be a substitute of the former -- one could choose the solution
which satisfies the highest number of constraints. Not sure if this would be
really useful in practice, though.



# Annotation guidelines

Thoroughly read the annotation guidelines for:
* FTB 
* Sequoia



# Various

Various minor things which would be nice to have before holidays:
* Show leaves in different color
* Mark non-projective trees "en rouge/rose"

# Question-answer windows

It would be very useful to have, in the long run, an implementation of something
like pop-up windows with questions and pre-defined sets of answers. This would
allow to perform, e.g., the validation mentioned above (#rule-based engine).



# Custom-parsing engine

This one would be nice...  Why don't we reimplement something nice?

This is something I can do before the summer vacations, and probably not
afterwards, which is why it made it to this list here.
