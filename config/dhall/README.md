Dhall Conventions
=================

We can use extensions:

* .typ to mark files with types
* .fun to mark files with functions
* .val to mark values (zero-variable functions)

Modules have no extensions.


Capitalization
--------------

We require no convention regarding capitalization. 

However, to make it more Haksell-ish, it makes sense to:

* capitalize modules
* capitalize types
* capitalize neither functions nor values
