    <p>This is a guide to annotation of the ODIL files with Contemplata.</p>

    <p>
      Annotation is performed at different levels:
      <a href="/user/guide#syntax">syntax</a>,
      <a href="/user/guide#entities">termporal entities</a>, and
      <a href="/user/guide#relations">termporal relations</a>.
      A dedicated section to each of these levels can be found below.

      <h4>Tableau de bord</h4>
      <p>
        At your <a href="/user/files">Files</a> subpage, you will find the list of
        files to which you have access. The files listed in the <b>Write</b>
        section are for you to annotate. They are divided in three categories.
        The <b>Waiting</b> and <b>In progress</b> files are the files waiting
        for annotation and the files you started annotating, respectively.
        When you finally finish annotating the file, click on <b>finish</b> to
        move it to the <b>Done</b> section. Files gathered in this section can
        be no loger modified. You can also click on <b>postpone</b> to revert
        the file to the waiting list.
      </p>

      <p>
        As for the files to which you only have the <b>Read</b> access, they are
        either for others to annotate or left in the database for archival
        purposes. Still, they can serve you as a reference for comparison with
        your own annotations.
      </p>

      <h4>Annotation mode</h4>
      <p>
        When you click on a particular file, you will be moved to the annotation
        mode. It consists of two annotation workspaces, top and bottom, each
        showing a syntactic tree assigned to a particular speech turn(s) in the
        file. The side window, placed on the right, can be switched between: (i)
        the <b>Context</b>, showing the list of the speech turns in the file,
        with the turn being annotated marked in bold, (ii) the <b>Edit</b>
        mode, showing the various attributes which can be annotated for the
        selected tree node, and (iii) the <b>Messages</b> received from the
        server.

      <h4>Navigation in the annotation mode</h4>
      <p>
         To navigate between the turns in the annotation mode you can either
         click on a particular turn in the <b>Context</b> side window, or press
         <em>Page Up</em> and <em>Page Down</em> to move up and down in the
         file, respectively.
