TODO:
* Simplify Model.moveCursor
* Make it possible to link two nodes in two viewports.
  Generally, it should also work if the two nodes are
  in the same tree.
* Make a flat message window on the bottom


LATER:
* Improve indentation when editing elm files
* Show a sentence on top of a given viewport


DONE:
* Make dragging independent in both windows
* Make it possible to work with several trees
* Make one of the windows focused
* Make it possible to switch between trees
* Show the tree id
* Make selection tree-dependent
* Rose trees with actual words
* Make it possible to modify node labels
* Make drawing artefacts disappear
* Better code organization in the View module
* Delete chosen node(s), provided that they are not roots
* Add common parent to a group of nodes
* Make the scrollbar on the bottom disappear
* Make the proportion between the two windows configurable
* Compute the absolute size of the entire window
* Make it possible to focus on the edit field
* A function which returns a position of the node with
  a given ID in a given tree.  Once you have it, it should
  be possible to draw a line between two positions.
* Simplify how the positions and grabbing are handled
* Simplify the way positions in the trees are calculated
* Simplify some functions related to windows
